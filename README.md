# JScore

This is a Java library to help to create and process midi data. 
This is just an abstraction over the java.sound.midi package. 
It provides a more intuative way to create notes, chords, chord progressions scales, keys and songs.
JScore tries to use music theory to aid in the creation of midi songs.
JScore is a good library to use to generate random midi files or read and edit midi files.
